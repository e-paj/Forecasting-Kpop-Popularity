Update for August 9-13:

August 9:
- Ok, I recently finished my IBM course online, hence, I can put more time towards this project.
- I've built more models for the Jpop data (I do need to study it more)
- I plan on finishing this project by the 13th, but if not feasible then till next week. 
- Can't do much from the 19-23 as family will be doing something.
