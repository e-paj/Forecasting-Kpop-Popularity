Update for August 9-13:

August 9-10:
- Ok, I recently finished my IBM course online, hence, I can put more time towards this project.
- I've built more models for the Jpop data (I do need to study it more)
- I plan on finishing this project by the 13th, but if not feasible then till next week. 
- Can't do much from the 19-23 as family will be doing something. 

August 11:
- Ok, I finished writing a report for the Jpop data. It is not as comprehensive as the other report I have, but it's good!
- Now, my job for this is to compare my results for both Kpop and Jpop data.
- See how the results of each data will compare to the other.
- Honestly, that kind of analysis is out of scope of the course, so I might have to do some research on how to properly do that.
